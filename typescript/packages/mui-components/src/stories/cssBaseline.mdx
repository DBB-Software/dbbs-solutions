# CssBaseline

We provide a CssBaseline component to kickstart an elegant and consistent baseline to build upon.

## Import
  
  ```jsx  
  import CssBaseline from '@mui-components/CssBaseline'; 
  ``` 

## Global reset 
You might be familiar with `normalize.css`, a collection of HTML element and attribute style-normalizations.

```jsx
import React from "react";
 import CssBaseline from '@mui-components/CssBaseline'; 

export const MyApp = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <CssBaseline />
    {/* The rest of your application */}
  </React.Fragment>
);
```

## Scoping on Children

However, you might be progressively migrating a website to Material UI, using a global reset might not be an option. It's possible to apply the baseline only to the children by using the `ScopedCssBaseline` component.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import ScopedCssBaseline from '@mui-components/material/ScopedCssBaseline';
import MyApp from './MyApp';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ScopedCssBaseline>
      {/* The rest of your application */}
      <MyApp />
    </ScopedCssBaseline>
  );
}
```
!Make sure you import ScopedCssBaseline first to avoid box-sizing conflicts as in the above example.

## Approach

### Page
The `<html>` and `<body>` elements are updated to provide better page-wide defaults. More specifically:

- The margin in all browsers is removed.
- The default Material Design background color is applied. It's using theme.palette.background.default for standard devices and a white background for print devices.
- If enableColorScheme is provided to CssBaseline, native components color will be set by applying color-scheme on `<html>`. The value used is provided by the theme property theme.palette.mode.

### Layout

- box-sizing is set globally on the `<html>` element to border-box. Every elementâ€”including `*::before` and `*::after` are declared to inherit this property, which ensures that the declared width of the element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
