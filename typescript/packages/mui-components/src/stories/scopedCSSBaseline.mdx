# CssBaseline

Sometimes, you might be progressively migrating a website to Natura Design System, and using a global reset might not be an option


It is possible to apply the baseline only to the children by using the ScopedCssBaseline component.

  
  ```jsx  
import React from "react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";
import ScopedCssBaseline from "@mui-components/ScopedCssBaseline";

export const MyAppWithScopedStyles = () => (
  <ScopedCssBaseline>
    {/* The rest of your application */}
    <MyApp />
  </ScopedCssBaseline>
);
  ``` 
⚠️ Make sure you import ScopedCssBaseline first - as in the example above - to avoid box-sizing conflicts.

The API documentation of the ScopedCssBaseline React component. Learn more about the props.
